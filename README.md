# tmc-uploader
First micro-service for the TMC app. This one is responsible for upload data from users.

## Development

Create a virtual environment for your Python interpreter and install all modules listed in `requirements.txt`

Activate the environment and kick off the application with `python flask_app.py`

You'll need to have a local PostgreSQL database running, or tunnel into PythonAnywhere to expose the remote database as if it were local.
